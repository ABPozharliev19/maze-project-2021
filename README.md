# ðŸ’» About

<p align="center"><strong>Our project is a highly engaging, story-based, rogue-like, skill-based, speedrun-optimized, randomized  game, related to the Babylon tower. It consists of a main menu, lobby and 2 random generated mazes for each floor. Each floor has 2 mazes in it and every maze can have up to 3 types of scrolls in it.</strong></p>

# Storyline

**You are a lost adventurer. It's dark, and you can't see anything. While wondering around, trying to find a way to escape the darkness, you come around the entrance of the famous Babylon tower. Because the tower is famous for ligthing the way, you go in. But before you can find your way, you need to go through series of mazes. But fear not, there are all types of scrolls left from previous adventurers to help you. Solve the mazes, find all the runes and light your way!**

# Gameplay
