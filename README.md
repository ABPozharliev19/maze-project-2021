                                          To be tested

- 	Path finding algorithm

- 	Game mechanics and graphics

- 	Main menu of the game
---
                                      Deadline and criteria

    Start of the project:

    - 15.10.2021

    Start expectations:

    - Make sure the game algorithm is working

    End of the project:

    - 10.11.2021

    End expectations:

    - Run the whole game without any bugs and problems
---
                                      Strategy for testing
   - Check multiple times everything the developers have make is working properly. 
    Reassure everything is working properly after every new added peace of the game. 
    Give special attention to the high priority parts of the program.
---
                                             Risks

-   There might be problems with game engine, game mechanics, 
    figuring out the main algorithm for the game.

---
                                             To do
- Figure out the main game algorithm, make a design for the game, create a main menu,   figure out the character and game mechanics and more.
